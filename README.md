I have completed my first ANGULAR project: Checklist! 🚀 In this TypeScript-based project, I implemented Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and added filtering and adding functionalities. Users can add checklist items, filter them based on specific criteria, and enjoy a structured listing experience. It was a great project to explore the power of Angular! 🎯🔥
